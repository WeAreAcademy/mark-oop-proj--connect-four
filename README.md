## Context

You work for a game development company.

After your [great work on Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-oop-proj--tic-tac-toe), you have been tasked with creating a Connect Four game.

A colleague has given you two things as a starting point:
1. `connect-four.spec.ts`: some tests to guide your work; and
2. `connect-four.ts`: some starter code (an interface and some types).

## Exercise 1: First thoughts and plans

Record some initial thoughts on the project.

You might find it helpful to consider the following prompts:

1. What are the similarities and differences between this proposed Connect Four game and your previous Tic Tac Toe game?
2. Which of the tests are easier and harder to decipher the intent behind?
3. How should the game work? Can you sketch out an example?


## Exercise 2: Tackle the tests

Now it's time to try to write code to make the tests pass.

You might find it more manageable to be focused with the tests you tackle - check out the Jest documentation on [`.only`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#testonlyname-fn-timeout) and [`.skip`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#testskipname-fn).
